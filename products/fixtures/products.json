The second pattern for comments will match comments/page-2/ with keyword argument page_number set to 2. The outer argument in this case is a non-capturing argument (?:...).\r\n\r\nThe blog_articles view needs the outermost captured argument to be reversed, page-2/ or no arguments in this case, while comments can be reversed with either no arguments or a value for page_number.\r\n\r\nNested captured arguments create a strong coupling between the view arguments and the URL as illustrated by blog_articles: the view receives part of the URL (page-2/) instead of only the value the view is interested in. This coupling is even more pronounced when reversing, since to reverse the view we need to pass the piece of URL instead of the page number.\r\n\r\nAs a rule of thumb, only capture the values the view needs to work with and use non-capturing arguments when the regular expression needs an argument but the view ignores it.",
